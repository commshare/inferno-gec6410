inferno-gec6410
===============

A port of inferno-os on gec6410-s3c6410.

This port is based on inferno-os on raspberry.
http://lynxline.com/projects/labs-portintg-inferno-os-to-raspberry-pi/
The inferno-os source codes are on https://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/

Inferno-os is a distributed operating system, originally developed at Bell labs.Applications written in Inferno's concurrent programming language, Limbo, are compiled to its portable virtual machine code (Dis), to run anywhere on a network in the portable environment that Inferno provides. Unusually, that environment looks and acts like a complete operating system.
